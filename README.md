### Development and validation of a micro-QuEChERS method with high-throughput enhanced matrix removal followed with UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS for analysis of raspberry ketone-related phenolic compounds in adipose tissues

In this work, we developed a new method to measure raspberry ketone (RK) metabolites in adipose tissue. It involved using enhanced-matrix-removal in a 96-well plate for effective sample cleanup. Additionally, a reversed-phase C18 sorbent was utilized to enhance recovery after SpeedVac drying. A stepwise recovery monitoring technique was developed for validation purposes. **See [original article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0039914021006378?via%3Dihub) published in _Talanta_.**

Data analysis was performed in R, and the script and output can be accessed [here](https://yuanbofaith.github.io/RK_adipose_QuEChERS_EMR).
